Farmer Joe wants to has many cows and wants to build a rectangular fence for his cows and has an
infinitely long wall he can build his fence against. Therefore, he only needs to build three sides of the fence
However, he has a limited budget
to go on. Can you help him find the largest area he can make his fence, given the 
budget and cost of fencing material?
P.S. Round the area down to the nearest integer. Joe hates paying land taxes!!!
