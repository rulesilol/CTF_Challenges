Bob is a amatuer cryptographer and designed his own cryptosystem. He has encrypted
an important message but has forgotten his seed (X, Y and Z). He vaguely remembers
that the first four psuedorandom numbers generate with his seed is: 1001996967, 
640617042, -96945703 and 1418336210. Can you help him decrypt the secret message?
